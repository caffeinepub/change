  "summary": "The implementation partially satisfies the requirements. REQ-11 is mostly implemented with the 10 rupee signup bonus credited during registration. However, REQ-12 is only partially satisfied as the signup bonus transaction lacks a proper task description indicating it is a signup bonus.",

      "requirement": "Create a transaction record with task description indicating it is a signup bonus",
      "reason": "The signup bonus transaction is created with taskId = 0 but there is no task description field in the Transaction type that would identify it as a 'signup bonus'. The Transaction type only has 'user', 'taskId', 'amount', and 'timestamp' fields, lacking any description or label to indicate this is a signup bonus rather than a regular task completion.",
