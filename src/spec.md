# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Award a 10 rupee signup bonus to new users automatically on their first login.

**Planned changes:**
- Modify backend user registration logic to credit 10 rupees to new users' accounts upon first registration
- Create a transaction record in the transaction history showing the signup bonus for new users
- Ensure the bonus is only awarded once per user and not to existing users

**User-visible outcome:** New users will receive 10 rupees in their account balance immediately upon first signup, which will be visible in their earnings and transaction history.
